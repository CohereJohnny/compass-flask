# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Overview
Cohere Compass SDK Web Interface is a web application that provides an interactive interface for working with the Cohere Compass SDK. It allows users to manage document indexes, upload documents, search through indexes, chat with documents using Cohere's LLM models, and explore the API capabilities.

## Target Audience
- Developers working with document retrieval systems
- Data scientists implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solutions
- Knowledge workers needing to chat with and search through document collections
- Organizations building document-based AI assistants

## User Personas

### Developer Alex
- **Role**: Software developer implementing document search for an organization
- **Goals**: 
  - Quickly set up and test indexes before integration
  - Understand API capabilities and limits
  - Try out different configurations
- **Pain Points**: 
  - Command line tools lack visual feedback
  - Documentation alone is insufficient for understanding

### Knowledge Worker Maya
- **Role**: Research analyst who needs to quickly extract information from documents
- **Goals**:
  - Ask natural language questions about document content
  - Receive accurate, sourced answers
  - Search and browse through document collections
- **Pain Points**:
  - Too many documents to read manually
  - Keyword search isn't contextual enough

### Data Scientist Jordan
- **Role**: Building RAG systems with Cohere's technology
- **Goals**:
  - Test different models and retrieval settings
  - Understand model behavior with different contexts
  - Prototype before full implementation
- **Pain Points**:
  - Need visual interface to demonstrate to stakeholders
  - Want quick iteration without coding changes
